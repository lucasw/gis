GIS stuff, play with openstreetmap, U.S. census, data.seattle.gov data.

census
======

http://bmander.com/dotmap/methods.html

    for i in `seq -w 1 56`; do wget ftp://ftp2.census.gov/geo/tiger/TIGER2010BLKPOPHU/tabblock2010_${i}_pophu.zip; done

TBD - host all the same data in a google drive and link to it here

The FIPS code link on the dotmap page is dead, so look to wikipedia:

US53 is Washington State.
