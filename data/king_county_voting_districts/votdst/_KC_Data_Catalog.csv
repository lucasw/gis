The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts; however; each TIGER/Line File is designed to stand alone as an independent data set; or they can be combined to cover the entire nation.  Census Blocks are statistical areas bounded on all sides by visible features; such as streets; roads; streams; and railroad tracks; and/or by nonvisible boundaries such as city; town; township; and county limits; and short line-of-sight extensions of streets and roads.  Census blocks are relatively small in area; for example; a block in a city bounded by streets.  However; census blocks in remote areas are often large and irregular and may even be many square miles in area.  A common misunderstanding is that data users think census blocks are used geographically to build all other census geographic areas; rather all other census geographic areas are updated and then used as the primary constraints; along with roads and water features; to delineate the tabulation blocks.  As a result; all 2010 Census blocks nest within every other 2010 Census geographic area; so that Census Bureau statistical data can be tabulated at the block level and aggregated up to the appropriate geographic areas.

Each feature is represented by a single point describing the centroid of the feature. Multiple points for a single XY coordinate may exist if more than one domain is represented. In other words; a single feature may represent a hospital; but that same point may be represented by another feature (i.e.; record) described as a Public Health Clinic.

idxp7500,idxp7500_area,survey,IDXP7500 - 7500-ft Tiling Index for King County Raster Data,A spatial tiling index designed for storage of file-based image and other raster (i.e.; LiDAR elevation; landcover) data sets. A regular grid with origin at 0;0 of the Washington North State Plane Coordinate System; with grid cells defined by orthogonal bounds 7500 feet long in easting and in northing. Only those cells currently involved in one of several image/raster data projects for King County and southwestern Snohomish County are labelled; though the labeling scheme can be extended. The name of the spatial index is derived from the acronym (I)n(D)e(X) (P)olygons at the (7500) foot tile level; or idxp7500. Cell label is a row-id cocantenated with a column-id generating a four-character identifier that uniquely identifies every cell. The row portion of the identifier is a two-character alpha code of the format aa; ab; ac.... ba; bb; etc. and the column portion is a two-digit integer value such as 01; 02; 03.... 11;12;13; etc. A composite cell identifier would be then; for example; aa01; aa02; .....ba11;ba12; etc. Not all image and raster data is stored at the tiling level represented by this index. Data is stored at this level if full-resolution; uncompressed data would generate larger than manageable file sizes at a larger tile size.
idxptrmbr,idxptrmbr_area,survey,IDXPTRMBR - Township Tiling Index for King County Raster Data,A spatial tiling index designed for storage of file-based image and other raster (i.e.; LiDAR elevation; landcover) data sets. An irregular grid of overlapping polygons; each enclosing its respective Public Land Survey System (PLSS) township in an orthogonal polygon minimally encompassing all portions of that township; i.e.; minimum bounding rectangle. The amount of overlap between adjacent tiles varies depending on the geometry of the underlying township. Currently extended to include all townships within or partially within King County as well as those townships in the southwestern portion of Snohomish County included within King County's ESA/SAO project area. The name of the spatial index is derived from the acronym (I)n(D)e(X) (P)olygons for (T)ownship-(R)ange; (M)inimum (B)ounding (R)ectangle; or idxptrmbr. Tile label is the t(township number)r(range number)as in t24r02. The meridian zone identifiers; N for townships and E for range is inferred as this index is intended as a local index for ease of use by the majority of users of GIS data. Lowercase identifiers are used for consistency between Unix and Windows OS storage. This index or tile level is the primary user-access level for most LiDAR elevation; orthoimagery and high-resolution raster landcover data. However; not all image and raster data is stored at the tiling level if a given data's resolution does not justify storing the data as multiple tiles.

noise_contours_1db,noise_contours_1db_area,enviro,One Decibel Noise Contours for King County International Airport,Noise contours are based on noise and contour modeling. Contour modeling is a very key element of the FAA FAR Part 150 Study. It is imperative that these contours be accurate for the meaningful analysis of airport and roadway noise impacts. The noise contours can then be used to predict the changes to the noise environment as a result of any of the development alternatives under consideration. The FAA Integrated Noise Model (INM) Version 6 was used to model the flight operations contours at King County International Airport (KCIA). INM Version 6 was released for use in October 1999. One of the most important factors in generating accurate noise contours is the collection of accurate operational data. The INM programs require the input of the physical and operational characteristics of the airport. Physical characteristics include runway coordinates; airport altitude; and temperature and optionally; topographical data. Operational characteristics include various types of aircraft data. This includes not only the aircraft types and flight tracks; but also departure procedures; arrival procedures and stage lengths that are specific to the operations at the airport. Aircraft data needed to generate noise contours include: number of aircraft operations by type; types of aircraft; day/evening/night time distribution by type; flight tracks; flight track utilization by type; flight profiles; typical operational procedures; and average meteorological conditions.

tracts10,tracts10_area,census,2010 Census Tracts for King County - Conflated to Parcels,The TIGER/Line Files are shapefiles and related database files (.dbf) that are an extract of selected geographic and cartographic information from the U.S. Census Bureau's Master Address File / Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (MAF/TIGER) Database (MTDB).  The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts; however; each TIGER/Line File is designed to stand alone as an independent data set; or they can be combined to cover the entire nation.  Census Blocks are statistical areas bounded on all sides by visible features; such as streets; roads; streams; and railroad tracks; and/or by nonvisible boundaries such as city; town; township; and county limits; and short line-of-sight extensions of streets and roads.  Census blocks are relatively small in area; for example; a block in a city bounded by streets.  However; census blocks in remote areas are often large and irregular and may even be many square miles in area.  A common misunderstanding is that data users think census blocks are used geographically to build all other census geographic areas; rather all other census geographic areas are updated and then used as the primary constraints; along with roads and water features; to delineate the tabulation blocks.  As a result; all 2010 Census blocks nest within every other 2010 Census geographic area; so that Census Bureau statistical data can be tabulated at the block level and aggregated up to the appropriate geographic areas.  Census blocks cover all territory in the United States; Puerto Rico; and the Island Areas (American Samoa; Guam; the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands; and the U.S. Virgin Islands).  Blocks are the smallest geographic areas for which the Census Bureau publishes data from the decennial census.  A block may consist of one or more faces.
